Dynamics: deals with force and why objects move as they do\n translational motion is when objects move without rotation (a point particle can only undergo translational motion)  2.1: Reference Frames and Displacement #    measurements are taken from a certain viewpoint → called a reference frame in physics\n a man walking at 5 km/h on a bus going 80 km/h would be going 85 km/h, with respect to the ground one should always specify reference frame    we can change what direction positive and negative are, this is the conventional coordinate axes (with the origin at 0)\n  Recall : displacement is a vector, a quantity with both magnitude (length of a vector) and direction\n  2.2: Average Velocity #   speed is not a vector, it lacks direction  velocity is a vector   Average Speed = distance traveled / time elapsed # convert to math form later Average Velocity = displacement / time elapsed  2.3: Instantaneous Velocity #   Instantaneous Velocity = ____  has the same magnitude as instantenous speed on a position vs time graph, instantenous velocity is equal to the slope    2.4: Acceleration #   Acceleration is the change of velocity per unit of time Average Accelerationn = change in velocity / change in time  2.5: Motion at Constant Acceleration #   Instantaneous acceleration is the average of acceleration taken over an infitesimally short time interval # math shi  2.6: Solving Problems #   kinematics eqs !¡  2.7: Freely Falling Objects #   in the absence of air reistance, all objects fall with the same constant acceleration  2.8: Variable Acceleration; Integral Calculus #     "},{"id":2,"href":"/notes/physics7a/3/","title":"Chapter 3: Kinematics in Two or Three Dimensions; Vectors","section":"Physics 7A","content":"kjhkjkjhs\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/notes/docs/math54/","title":"Math 54","section":"Docs","content":"\u0026ldquo;Linear Alegbra I\u0026rdquo;\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/notes/docs/cs61b/","title":"CS 61B","section":"Docs","content":"\u0026ldquo;Seek out knowledge\u0026rdquo;\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/notes/docs/physics7a/","title":"Physics 7A","section":"Docs","content":"\u0026ldquo;On the way to become a Quantum God\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nChapters #   Chapter 1: Intro, Measurement, Estimating Chapter 2: Describing Motion: Kinematics in 1D Chapter 3: Kinematics in Two or Three Dimensions; Vectors  "}]
