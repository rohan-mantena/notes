Kinematics: description of how objects move 2. Dynamics: deals with force and why objects move as they do
translational motion is when objects move without rotation (a point particle can only undergo translational motion) 2.1: Reference Frames and Displacement # measurements are taken from a certain viewpoint â†’ called a reference frame in physics</description></item><item><title>Chapter 3: Kinematics in Two or Three Dimensions; Vectors</title><link>https://rohan-mantena.github.io/notes/physics7a/3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohan-mantena.github.io/notes/physics7a/3/</guid><description>kjhkjkjhs</description></item><item><title>Project 0</title><link>https://rohan-mantena.github.io/notes/cs61b/projcect0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohan-mantena.github.io/notes/cs61b/projcect0/</guid><description>project-home-page summary of instructions # setup: the puzzle # : the actual puzzle is a grid of empty square cells (the board) and a set of a number of pieces that are in the form of a configuration of those sqaure cell blocks (one's hand) - after each piece is placed, any cells that have been filled are cleared - after all the pieces inone&amp;rsquo;s hand are placed, it is refilled with the same number of pieces as before - play continues until none of the pieces in the hand can fit anywhere on the board</description></item></channel></rss>
