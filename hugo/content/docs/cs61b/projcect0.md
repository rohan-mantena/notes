    : the actual puzzle is a grid of empty square cells (the board) and a set of a number of pieces that are in the form of a configuration of those sqaure cell blocks (one's hand)

    - after each piece is placed, any cells that have been filled are cleared
    - after all the pieces inone's hand are placed, it is refilled with the same number of  pieces as before 
    - play continues until none of the pieces in the hand can fit anywhere on the board 
    
    - **by default** the board consists of an 8x8 grid (64 cells) and the hand contains 3 pieces at a time - need to able to change these parameters though
