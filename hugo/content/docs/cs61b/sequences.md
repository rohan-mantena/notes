Topics include; views, maps, sentienls, stacks, adapters, and more. 

## Views 
- views (concept) are an alternative presentation of (interface to) an existing object : view implements inteface of object 
- a not concrete analogy for a view is a pointer into object

## Map Views?

## Partial Implementations 
- the idea of taking advantage of the fact that operations are releated 
- for designers, this can be used by implementing existing concrete types or interfaces. it is useful because if 'fills' in a lot 

## Stacks
- stacks are last in first out, i.e if you push 1,2,3 --> you pop them in 3,2,1
- rule of Demeter
