weight: 2
---
Mechanics: study of motion of objects, and the related concepts of forec and engergy
    1. Kinematics: description of how objects move
    2. Dynamics: deals with force and why objects move as they do 

- translational motion is when objects move without rotation (a [point particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle) can only undergo translational motion)
# 2.1: Reference Frames and Displacement
- measurements are taken from a certain viewpoint &rarr; called a reference frame in physics 
    - a man walking at 5 km/h on a bus going 80 km/h would be going 85 km/h, *with respect to the ground* 
    - one should always specify reference frame 

- we can change what direction positive and negative are, this is the conventional [coordinate axes](notes/physics7a/coordinateaxis.png) (with the origin at 0)
- Recall : displacement is a [vector](https://mathinsight.org/vector_introduction), a quantity with both magnitude (length of a vector) and direction



# 2.2: Average Velocity
- speed is not a vector, it lacks direction
    - velocity is a vector 
- **Average Speed** = distance traveled / time elapsed # convert to math form later 
- **Average Velocity** = displacement / time elapsed 

# 2.3: Instantaneous Velocity
- **Instantaneous Velocity** = ____
    - has the same magnitude as instantenous speed
    - on a position vs time graph, instantenous velocity is equal to the slope

# 2.4: Acceleration
- Acceleration is the change of velocity per unit of time
- **Average Accelerationn** = change in velocity / change in time  
# 2.5: Motion at Constant Acceleration 
-  Instantaneous acceleration is the average of acceleration taken over an infitesimally short time interval # math shi  

# 2.6: Solving Problems
- kinematics eqs !ยก

# 2.7: Freely Falling Objects
- in the absence of air reistance, all objects fall with the same constant acceleration 

# 2.8: Variable Acceleration; Integral Calculus 
- 
# 2.9: Graphical Analysis and Numerical Integration
