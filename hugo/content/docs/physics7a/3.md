# 3.1: Vectors and Scalars
- vectors have magnitude and direction
- those without magnitude (but with direction) are called scalar quantities 

# 3.2: Addition of Vectors - Graphical Methods 
- when considering displacement on a line, addition (and subtractino) is easy
- displacement when someone walks 10 km east, then walks 5 km (i.e a quantity with both value and direction), change in position = ?
- given the above example, one could graph this and see the following >>>

- because the vectors are perpindiuclar, we can use the pythagorean theorem to get the resultant vector 
- the max of a resultant vector can only vectors sum (as if they were on a straight line)
    - consider why all 90 degree lines that are added to make a vector can only produce perpindicularity
- formal graphical definition of vector addition
    "the arrow drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector is the sum of the two vectors" 

- there are various methods to add vectors visually >> including tail to tip and the parallelogram method, both ends of resultant vector cannot be touching the tips of component vectors (for addition)

# 3.3: Subtraction of Vectors, and Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar 
- defintion is intutive, but the negative of a vector is simply the same magnitude but opposite in direction (recall magnitude cannot be negative)

- to visually subtract vectors, consider the vector equation V2 - V1 # add this in later
    > how would we get the difference of the two vectors

# 3.4 Adding Vector by Components
- this method is more
