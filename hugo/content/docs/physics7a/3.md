# 3.1: Vectors and Scalars
- vectors have magnitude and direction
- those without magnitude (but with direction) are called scalar quantities 

# 3.2: Addition of Vectors - Graphical Methods 
- when considering displacement on a line, addition (and subtractino) is easy
- displacement when someone walks 10 km east, then walks 5 km (i.e a quantity with both value and direction), change in position = ?
- given the above example, one could graph this and see the following >>>

- because the vectors are perpindicular, we can use the pythagorean theorem to get the resultant vector 
- the max of a resultant vector can only vectors sum (as if they were on a straight line)
    - consider why all 90 degree lines that are added to make a vector can only produce perpindicularity
- formal graphical definition of vector addition
    "the arrow drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector is the sum of the two vectors" 

- there are various methods to add vectors visually >> including tail to tip and the parallelogram method, both ends of resultant vector cannot be touching the tips of component vectors (for addition)

# 3.3: Subtraction of Vectors, and Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar 
- defintion is intutive, but the negative of a vector is simply the same magnitude but opposite in direction (recall magnitude cannot be negative)

- to visually subtract vectors, consider the vector equation V2 - V1 # add this in later
    > how would we get the difference of the two vectors

# 3.4: Adding Vector by Components
- components of a vector are usually in perpindicular directinos (such as the x and y axse)
- given the resulation of a velocity vector, we can use trig to solve for the components 
- thus, we have 2 ways to specify vectors: 1. by components (Vx and Vy) 2.by magnitude V and direction theta it makes with positive x axis 
- the following example illustrates non-perpindicular compponents >> 
- is theta the angle v makes with the positive x axis 

### steps to adding vectors
1. Draw a diagram, adding the vectors (graphically) - either by parallelogram method or tip to tail 

>> do the rest after doing the homework 

# 3.5: Unit Vectors
- all vectors are simply scaled versions of the unit vectors (i hat, j hat, k hat) (x,y,z)
- V = Vxi + Vyj + Vzk // add math later 

# 3.6: Vector Kinematics
- // instantaneous def of veloicty and acceleration 
-  in 1D, displacement was defined as a change in position 
- however, in the case of 2 or 3 dimensions, the displacement vector is the vector representing change in position
- // eq.s
- instantaneous velocity is the limit of the average velocity as change in time approaches zero 
    - direction of the instantaneous veloicty is along the line tangent to the path at that moment 
- instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration vector as the time interval change in t is allowed to approach 0 
    instantaneous acceleration will be non-zero when the magnitude of velocity changes or if the direction changes 
    
- in 2D or 3D, constant acceleratino means ax, ay, az = 0 and the average acceleration is = instantaneous acceleration at any moment 

# 3.7: Projectile Motion
- basic info to solve problems
    - g = 9.80
    - t = 0
    - x0 = y0 = 0

# 3.8: Solving Problems Involving Projectile Motion 
// revisit once done with hw 

# 3.9: Relative Velocity
- If 2 particles are on the same line, determinng their velocities, relative to each other, is a matter of simple addition / subtraction
- When they are not along the same line, vector addition is used. 
- Label carefully to maintain distinct and unambigious reference frames
