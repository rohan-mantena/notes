# 4.1: Force
- Force, as it is largely known, is a push or pull on an object
- Force is needed to accelerate an object 
- Force is a vector

# 4.2: Newton's First Law of Motion 
- Galileo imagined an idealealized world &rarr; one without friction 
- With this in mind, Galileo realized that without force on a moving object, it will continue to move with constant speed in a straight line
- This idea leads into Newton's 1st Law
    - Every object continues in its state of rest, or of uniform velocity in a staight line, as long as no net force acts on it. 
    - the tendency of an object to maintain its state of rest or of uniform velocity in a straight line is called inertia 
- inertial reference frames are frames in which Newton's 1st law holds (constant velocity / non-accelerating frames)

# 4.3: Mass 
- in physics, mass is the measure of inertia 
    &rarr; the more mass an object has, the greater force required to give it an acceleration
- mass is not weight 
    - mass is a property (its quantity of matter)
    - weight is a force, the pull of gravity acting on an object
    
# 4.4: Newton's Second Law of Motion
- Net force causes acceleration
    - consider how one would push a cart and how that would affect acceleration and time 
- the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, and is inversely proportional to the object's mass. The direction of the acceleration is in the direction of net force acting on the object 
>> math equations from txtbook

- intuitive, but, the component of acceleration in each direction is affected only the component ot the net force in that direction 
- ++ // eqs
- given defintion of mass as inertia, acceleration or mass of 2 objects with equal force can be found via m1/m2 = a1/a2

# 4.5: Newton's Third Law of Motion
**formal definition: whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first**
