Kinematics: description of how objects move 2. Dynamics: deals with force and why objects move as they do
translational motion is when objects move without rotation (a point particle can only undergo translational motion) 2.1: Reference Frames and Displacement # measurements are taken from a certain viewpoint → called a reference frame in physics</description></item><item><title>Chapter 3: Kinematics in Two or Three Dimensions; Vectors</title><link>https://rohan-mantena.github.io/notes/physics7a/3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohan-mantena.github.io/notes/physics7a/3/</guid><description>3.1: Vectors and Scalars # vectors have magnitude and direction those without magnitude (but with direction) are called scalar quantities 3.2: Addition of Vectors - Graphical Methods # when considering displacement on a line, addition (and subtractino) is easy
displacement when someone walks 10 km east, then walks 5 km (i.e a quantity with both value and direction), change in position = ?</description></item><item><title>Chapter 4:</title><link>https://rohan-mantena.github.io/notes/physics7a/4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohan-mantena.github.io/notes/physics7a/4/</guid><description>4.1: Force # Force, as it is largely known, is a push or pull on an object Force is needed to accelerate an object Force is a vector 4.2: Newton&amp;rsquo;s First Law of Motion # Galileo imagined an idealealized world → one without friction With this in mind, Galileo realized that without force on a moving object, it will continue to move with constant speed in a straight line This idea leads into Newton&amp;rsquo;s 1st Law Every object continues in its state of rest, or of uniform velocity in a staight line, as long as no net force acts on it.</description></item></channel></rss>
